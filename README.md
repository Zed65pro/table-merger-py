# Table Merger App

A desktop application built with Python, using `tkinter` for the interface and `pandas` for data manipulation. This tool allows you to easily merge multiple tables (in CSV or Excel format) by specifying key columns and other options for manipulating the table.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library

Install `pandas` using pip if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app by going into the directory and running
```bash
python main.py
```
